We created an algorith that detects fall using python and libraries like opencv and a model YOLOv8n. It included: 
    Detecting a fall
    Sending alerts with the help of a telegram to a person that is connected through telegram id.
    Connected and tested with a real camera everything worked.

We divided our idea into a web version and a mobile application and denied the idea of the telegram bot notifications.

Mobile application:
    Created a basic app that includes dashboard, alerts, contacts, login, register and settings page.
    Connected it with the backend part.
    Added requirements and model, and database file.
    Changed the main algorithm that detects fall. Removed everything that is about telegram. Used flask for linking with the front.

Web:
    Designed a user-friendly UI for smooth navigation between app sections.
    Developed a React + TypeScript web interface that includes dashboard, alerts, contacts, login, register, and settings pages.
    Built a desktop version of the web app using Electron.js.
